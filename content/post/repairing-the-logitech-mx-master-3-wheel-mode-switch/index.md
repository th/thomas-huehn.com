I've been using a Logitech MX Master 3 mouse for about two years now.

Recently I noticed that the wheel mode switch button just below the primary wheel doesn't work anymore.

It should switch the mouse wheel from ratched mode to freespinning mode and back again.
Unfortunately, my mouse seemed to be stuck in ratched mode.

The “solution” was to take the mouse and thump it against my thigh.

There is a mechanism controlling the wheel mode that can mechanically get into a position where the magnetic control doesn't do anything.
When you thump the mouse hard (but against your flesh so it doesn't take damage), it gets unstuck and the magnetic control works again.

That's rather disappointing for such an expensive mouse that seems high quality, but it's a common problem that users all over the Internet are reporting.
