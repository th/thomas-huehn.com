Hyper-masculine attributions to a certain class of employees like “rock star” or “ninja developer” are commonplace.
But the rock star phrase has taken a life on its own. Originally it meant something else, which is a facet worth preserving. Think geology, not music business.

Kim Scott claims in “Radical Candor” that the phrase “rock star” in reference to developers was coined at Apple, and not with the current meaning of some extremely productive developer, but as a contrast to “super star”.

Where the super star is on an explosive career trajectory, always changing jobs, the rock star gets this name from the proverbial rock. The rock star is extremely good, as well, but doesn't aim for his boss's position and is content with his rank.

She does not devalue super stars per se, but a healthy team arguably needs the rock star more than the super star. Because the rock star is very important source of stability when it comes to team dynamics. Super stars leave after a short time, but rock stars can shape a workplace culture over a long time.
